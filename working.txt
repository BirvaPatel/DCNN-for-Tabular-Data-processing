Example:

suppose, we have an dataset with m(500k) samples and 28 attributes. 
training set = 400k
testing set = 100k

Here, 28 attributes means the nearest perfect square number of 28 is 36(6*6).
So, we need 36-28=8 nodes in the hidden dense layer. 
built the NN with last layer with the number of classes. 
Now, train whole Nuaral network with 'adam' optimizer with only training data.
Then, we need to extract the feature from the hidden layer for the training and testing inputs only.
Now, we got (m,8) from (m,28) in the extracted layer and concatenate on the horizonal axis.
now, we got (m,28) + (m,8) = (m,36).
now, reshape it (m,6,6)
now, resize it using PIL library and get (m,32,32)
now, copy it 3 times on the z-axis in order to get rgb like image and get (m,32,32,3).
now, It will be ready to enter in DenseNet121 model from the keras.
now, train the model with training set and evaluate it on the testing set.

Note: we didn't use the test labels in whole process untill the last final training.
